# Correlation Matrix Visualization

**Email (for validation): 23f1000504@ds.study.iitm.ac.in**

This project visualizes correlations between numerical features using a correlation matrix and saves:
- `correlation.csv` — the correlation matrix
- `heatmap.png` — a Red–White–Green conditional-format heatmap (400–512 px)

## Dataset
Place your numeric dataset at the root as `data.csv` (or directly provide a precomputed `correlation.csv`).

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
